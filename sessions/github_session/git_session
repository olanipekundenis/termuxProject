I now believe that thier are certain days that I should be more careful about where i go OR whatever I do! Its very important that I try as much as possible to makes sure
    that whatever I do in such days are done with higher level of consciousness. Instead doing things hapharzadly, it is important that I pay more attention to such days
    such as January 3. Today was really not as cool. I was just wondering here and there, loosing stuffs up and down.
    
Another thing one should pay more attention to is Numerology. Its pertinent that I know the numbers that are mostly compartible with me. Since I've found that some numbers
    are not that much compactible, I should find a way that whatever I'm doing I take cognizance of such numbers
    
Going to U.I should equally be done sparingly instead of done every time.. And moreso at this junction I should desist from being friendly with any of this girls. Staying 
    by myself most times should be mostly sherished. Amongst things things that I should take note of are:
        1. Finding a lone time to do thing on my own.  
        2. Finding times to be by myself.
        3. learning how to improve my communication skill and be more eloquent.
        4. I should start using Adin-Agbon to cream my hair
        5. I should practise using the 

Subsequently, I should just find one programming language that I would be using every time and try to stick with it this new year. Learning programming language require being 
    expert in a preferred one. By now, I actually need to have become very skill at a programming language. Using the vim-keys should'nt go unutilized. It's very important that
    I find a programming language that I can use every time. Examples of languages that I can use everytime is 
       1. Bash Scripting for operating linux
       2. C++ for solving programming question
       3. Python for solving programming question
       4. Javascript for traversing the DOM.
    These goes to show that any programming language you choose is applicable above. But the one I'd like to be an expert on is C++ 

Therefore, henceforth I should endeavour to write anything I want to write in this fashion in other to follow the PROGRAMMING/APA format of indentation. Anytime you need to 
    test-run your typing skill, what you need to do is to make sure that you endeavour to do it with this partiicular style of wriiting. Using things like dots(.) is really
    very powerful. Things to take note of when using vi.
        i.  using the "C" to knip the bud of further sentence (for the opposite of "C" = "S")
        ii. using the "A" to go to the end of the line.
        iii.using the "I" to go to the beginning of the line.
        iv. using the "S" to knip the bud to the beginning of the line.
        v.  using the "ciw" instead of "cw".
        vi. using the "ce" and "cb" more often.
    Its like starting to write something and remembering that you could have framed it in another way entirely, and decided to start all over again. This is just exemplarily 
    wonderful way of writting things 

Most times in the evening I just crashed. I think I should start forming habits of just trying to type everything on my mind. I guess this would improve my typings tremendously
    if i should be doing just that I should be able to gain more insight towards achieving things trememdously. I want to say, there are so many things in my mind that I just 
    find ways of achieving. I'm starting this year with of 
    One of the important things that one can do is to ensure that one tries as much as possible to exercise your communication talent most effective. One thing that people do is 
    that they forget easily. They forget when you sacrifice for them, they forget when you help them in one way or they other. What you just need to do mostly is to look after 
    your health most judiciously. And make sure that your life is long enough. Then practise what you've learnt over the years everyday. Everyday practise is most important. 
    And every single person has his/her own way of doing things. But my beileve is if one should practise a craft every single day one would eventually gain insights on ways 
    to improve the way. I think to become a writter is to become a speaker. Amongst becoming a wrtiter and a speaker, the best is becoming a speaker- cos we speak more than we 
    write

Trying to find a way in which I can navigate this Ship. I'm just tired having no course. I really would'nt want to start creating a job for this one that does'nt value me in
    entirety. I think I should think of how I can provide a job for my daughter as soon as she finishes Secondary Sch- this will alleviate trying to provide supporting her all
    through my life and it will give me a chance to make something out of my own life. The very best way to squeeze myself out of this hole is to focus on my daughter only. 
    This woman is just so lazy 

Equally, by following Tomnonnon's method of Terminal Data Wrangling(check video on youtube), one can become very proficient at using the terminal more. Moreso, using latex
    type for doing your all text, would make you most proficient at working at the command line. Therefore, since you mostly work with text in this context its most important 
    to be proficient with latex. The most problem is to be able to be able to  edit with vi and find a way to juggle between viewing it on pdf editing on vi.
