These are the steps I used at uploading to github from termux:

1. I generated a PAT
2. I input the PAT on .git/config at the remote origin section as thus
    https://ghp_mygeneratedPAT@github.com/olanipekundenis/termuxProject
3. Then I use this command 'git push --set-upstream origin master' giving 
    to me after I ran git status. This command is used for saving the setup
4. Then I proceeded to use the ascp-film which are regular git commands
    in my home directory. Caveat if you try to write to a dir u dnt have +w
    power it wont accept it, so ways use your home dir in termux
