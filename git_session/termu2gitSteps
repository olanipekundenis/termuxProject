These are the steps I used at uploading to github from termux:

1. I generated a PAT
2. I input the PAT on .git/config at the remote origin section as thus
    https://ghp_mygeneratedPAT@github.com/olanipekundenis/termuxProject
3. Then I use this command 'git push --set-upstream origin master' giving 
    to me after I ran git status
